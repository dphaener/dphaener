    <h2>Thrive Nutrition and Fitness</h2>
    <p>A fitness and nutrition website that I started when I had high
      hopes of opening a company with the same name and ideals.  Of
      course, in my true style I only spent time creating the website
      because that's really what I love to do. Created with Drupal,
      I used mostly plugin modules other people had written, but the
      Nutrition Tracker portion (only available to logged in users) was
      written by yours truly....</p>

    <h2>Brewing Tools</h2>
    <p>Back in my former life, I was a professional brewer, and as I
      always do, found a way to work programming and complex spreadsheet
      development into my life and career. This is just a page of
      downloads that include spreadsheets, and software that I have
      written along the way....</p>
